# AES
Automated Essay Scoring with Deep Learning

# Some things for next steps:
* random permutation of the combined dataset
* Add early stop callback
* Smart checkpoint
* Include the other way of exporting and saving model, which saves the weights together with the model architecture
* Name each of the layers
* Try importing only some of the layers
* Output intermediate layers
* Import the word embedding from outside
* Freeze the word embedding layers
* Add proper metrics to show the easiness of training process

* Transfer learning using partially import and freeze layers
